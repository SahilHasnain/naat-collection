- Restart the app

### Audio Not Playing

- Check volume settings
- Ensure audio permissions are granted
- Try closing and reopening the app

## Technical Details

### How It Works

The live radio uses time-based synchronization:

1. A server tracks which naat is currently "playing" and when it started
2. When you join, the app calculates where in the naat you should be
3. Everyone plays the same naat at the same position = synchronized!

### Why No Seek Controls?

To maintain synchronization, seek controls are disabled. This ensures everyone hears the same thing at the same time.

### Data Usage

Live radio uses the same amount of data as regular playback - it's not actually streaming, just synchronized playback of regular audio files.
